Lyrics App

This is a simple app using Next.js and React which uses calls from an API fro 'Genius' lyrics to display lyrics to the user when the user provides the name of an artist or a track. 

It makes use of the React hook 'useState' to store the input from the user.

The 'search' endpoint of the API was used for fetching songs and the 'lyrics' endpoint was used to get the lyrics to the song.

The app has been styles with 'TailwindCSS'.
